# angular-structure-styleguide
A style guide for structuring modular angular applications

## Quick intro
In most angular applications the complexity of the code grows fairly rapidely. One way to battle this is by splitting up code over multiple files. However, if you do it the wrong way, this can work against you. 

The goal of this paper is introduce a new architectual schema that covers all aspects of structuring an angular application that is easy to maintain and a joy to build in.

*The below image is a quick overview of how the code will be structured using this styleguide.*
